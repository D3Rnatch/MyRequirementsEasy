Prototype to explore the use-cases of a Good requirement managing tool:
- Create documents that contains requirements and items
- Be able to keep track of changes easily
- Work together efficiently
- Manage traceabilities
- Snapshots revisions
- Later: connect to JIRA and generate automatic release letter containing the system functionalities.

Long work to go ;).

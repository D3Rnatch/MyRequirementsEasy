This project aims at exploring the use-cases of a good requirement managing tool.
It does not aim at providing the software in the first time but rather prototype it.

The main functionalities that are expected:
- Create and visualize documents
- Link documents together
- Track changes on documents
- Snapshots the documents (i.e store a revision at a given time of it)
